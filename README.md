# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
To complete the tasks, learners must:
1.Have access to a GitHub account and basic knowledge of creating repositories.
2.Be familiar with writing clear, structured markdown files in README.md.
3.Understand the SDLC process and the role of requirement analysis in it.
4.Have experience with tools like Draw.io or equivalent for creating diagrams.
5.Be able to conceptualize and articulate project requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
6.Access the case study for reference to the booking management system.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1.Real-world Application: The project emulates real-life software requirement analysis tasks to give learners hands-on experience with documentation and project planning.
2.Comprehensive Documentation: Develop detailed explanations of key concepts like requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
3.Visual Representations: Use diagrams to illustrate system actors and interactions for a clear and concise depiction of requirements.
4.Practical Insights: Learn how to define acceptance criteria and their role in ensuring project success.
5.Structured Learning Path: Each task builds on the previous one, reinforcing knowledge and application step-by-step.
6.Professional Standards: Emphasis on industry-standard practices ensures readiness for advanced-level projects and client engagements.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
### Requirement gathering
* interviews to gather detailed information about the expctations
* surveys/ questioniers to collect requirements from a larger audience
* workshops to disciss and gather the requirements
* Observation of the end-user in their working environment to understand their needs
* Document analysis revewing existing documentation and system to understand current functionalities and requirements.
### Requirement elicitation
* Brainstorming to generate ideas and gather requirements
* Focus groups with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements
* Prototyping to help visualize the system and refine the requirements
### Requirement documentation
* Requirement of specification document to create a detailed document that lists all the functional and non functional requirements
* Users stories to describe functionality from the users perspective
* Use cases creating use cases diagrams to show interactions between users and the stystem
### Requirement analysis and modeling
* Requiremet prioritazation based on their performance and impact
* feasiability analysis in terms of technical, financial and time constrains
* modeling to visualize and analyze requirements.
###Requirement Validation
* Review and approval to ensure accuracy and competence
* Acceptance criteria to ensure they meet the expoected standards
* Traceablity to ensure all requirements are addressed during development  and testing
