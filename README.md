# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
To complete the tasks, learners must:
1.Have access to a GitHub account and basic knowledge of creating repositories.
2.Be familiar with writing clear, structured markdown files in README.md.
3.Understand the SDLC process and the role of requirement analysis in it.
4.Have experience with tools like Draw.io or equivalent for creating diagrams.
5.Be able to conceptualize and articulate project requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
6.Access the case study for reference to the booking management system.
